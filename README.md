# clipboard-scraper
Small script i wrote to extract webpages from your clipboard using firefox's readability.js module.
Uses Albert Armea's [readability-scraper](https://github.com/aarmea/readability-scrape) project to do the dirty work.

## To use:
run `npm install -g readability-scrape`and `pip install pyperclip`.
Then run the python script and copy any link to your clipboard.
